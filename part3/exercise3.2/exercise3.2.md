# Exercise 3.2 A deployment pipeline to heroku

Let’s create our first deployment pipeline! <br>

For this exercise you can select which ever web application you already have containerized. <br>

If you don’t have any web applications available you can use any one from this course and modify it. (Such as the course material itself) <br>

Let’s use GitHub, CircleCI, and Heroku to deploy to heroku. You can also use GitHub actions instead of CircleCI. <br>

CircleCI offers orbs for Heroku deployment, but you can just use the instructions from Heroku (or exercise 1.16). <br>

Submit a link to the repository with the config. <br>

# Solution
Link to repository with the config: https://github.com/l0ve2cr3ate/frontend-example-docker <br>
You can find the config in the repository above in the Dockerfile, and in the workflow.yml file in `.github\workflows` folder. <br>
