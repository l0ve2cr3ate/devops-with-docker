# Exercise 2.10

Some buttons may have stopped working in the frontend + backend project. Make sure that every button for exercises works. <br>

This may need a peek into the browsers developer consoles again like back part 1. The buttons of nginx exercise and the first button behave differently but you want them to match. <br>

If you had to do any changes explain what you had to change. <br>

Submit the docker-compose yml and both dockerfiles. <br>

**Note**: setup of docker-compose.yml expects that you have tagged the frontend and backend images as exercise1.10 and exercise1.11 respectively.
