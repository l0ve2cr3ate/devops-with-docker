# Exercise 2.1

*Exercises in part 2 should be done using docker-compose* <br>

Container of `devopsdockeruh/first_volume_exercise` will create logs into its `/usr/app/logs.txt`. <br>

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file that starts `devopsdockeruh/first_volume_exercise` and saves the logs into your filesystem. <br>

Submit the docker-compose.yml, make sure that it works simply by running docker-compose up if the log file exists. <br>
