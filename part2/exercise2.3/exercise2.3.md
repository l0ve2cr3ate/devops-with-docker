# Exercise 2.3

As we saw previously, starting an application with two programs was not trivial and the commands got a bit long.

Since we already created working Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend we can go step further and simplify the usage into one docker-compose.yml.

Configure the backend and frontend from part 1 to work in docker-compose.

Submit the docker-compose.yml

**Note**: setup of docker-compose.yml expects that you have tagged the frontend and backend images as exercise1.10 and exercise1.11 respectively.
