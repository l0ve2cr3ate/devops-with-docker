# Exercise 1.16

Pushing to heroku happens in a similar way. A project has already been prepared at `devopsdockeruh/heroku-example` so lets pull that first. Note that the image of the project is quite large. <br>

Go to https://www.heroku.com/ and create a new app there and install heroku CLI. You can find additional instructions from Deploy tab under Container Registry. Tag the pulled image as `registry.heroku.com/_app_/_process-type_`, process-type can be `web` for this exercise. The app should be your project name in heroku. <br>

Then push the image to heroku with `docker push registry.heroku.com/_app_/web` and release it using the heroku CLI: `heroku container:release web` (you might need to login first:  `heroku container:login`) <br>

For this exercise return the url in which the released application is. <br>

You could also use the heroku CLI to build and push, but since we didnâ€™t want to build anything this time it was easier to just tag the image. <br>
