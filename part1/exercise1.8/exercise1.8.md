# Exercise 1.8

In this exercise we wonâ€™t create a new Dockerfile. Image `devopsdockeruh/first_volume_exercise` has instructions to create a log into `/usr/app/logs.txt`. Start the container with bind mount so that the logs are created into your filesystem. <br>

Submit your used commands for this exercise. <br>

# Solution

`$ docker run -v $(pwd)/logs.txt:/usr/app/logs.txt devopsdockeruh/first_volume_exercise`
